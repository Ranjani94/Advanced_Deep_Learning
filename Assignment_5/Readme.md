## Transformer

- Setting up the development environment, with the Pytorch-Transformers library by HuggingFace.
- Setting up pre-trained models.
- Implement multi head self attention as a Keras layer
- Implement a Transformer block as a layer
- Implement embedding layer: Two seperate embedding layers, one for tokens, one for token index (positions).
