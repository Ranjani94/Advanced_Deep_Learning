## Gradient Boosting

Boosting is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners. In boosting, each new tree is a fit on a modified version of the original data set. The gradient boosting algorithm (gbm) can be most easily explained by first introducing the AdaBoost Algorithm.The AdaBoost Algorithm begins by training a decision tree in which each observation is assigned an equal weight. After evaluating the first tree, we increase the weights of those observations that are difficult to classify and lower the weights for those that are easy to classify. The second tree is therefore grown on this weighted data.

Gradient Boosting trains many models in a gradual, additive and sequential manner. The major difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Algorithm is how the two algorithms identify the shortcomings of weak learners (eg. decision trees). While the AdaBoost model identifies the shortcomings by using high weight data points, gradient boosting performs the same by using gradients in the loss function (y=ax+b+e , e needs a special mention as it is the error term). The loss function is a measure indicating how good are modelâ€™s coefficients are at fitting the underlying data. A logical understanding of loss function would depend on what we are trying to optimise. For example, if we are trying to predict the sales prices by using a regression, then the loss function would be based off the error between true and predicted house prices.
