## Gradient Boosting

Boosting is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners. In boosting, each new tree is a fit on a modified version of the original data set. The gradient boosting algorithm (gbm) can be most easily explained by first introducing the AdaBoost Algorithm.The AdaBoost Algorithm begins by training a decision tree in which each observation is assigned an equal weight. After evaluating the first tree, we increase the weights of those observations that are difficult to classify and lower the weights for those that are easy to classify. The second tree is therefore grown on this weighted data.
